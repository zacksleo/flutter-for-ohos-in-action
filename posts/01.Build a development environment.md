# HarmonyOS Flutter in action: 01 - Build a development environment

## Preparation

1. Install [DevEco Studio NEXT IDE] (https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-studio/), note that the version should be Next, and the latest version is Beta3

2. Install Git, if you want to adapt to Android at the same time, you need to install Android Studio; If you want to adapt to ios, you need to install Xcode

## Manage multiple Flutter versions

If you need to use multiple versions of Flutter in your project development, you can consider using fvm

1. Install [FVM] (https://fvm.app/)
2. Use the official Flutter version of FVM

```bash
fvm install 3.22.0
```

3. Install the custom HarmonyOS version and go to the fvm/version directory, which is usually located in the user directory, such as '~/fvm/versions/3.22.0',
Copy the repository and rename it to 'custom_x.y.z'

```bash
git clone -b dev https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/flutter_flutter.git custom_3.7.12
```
> Note that the naming format must be 'custom_x.y.z', i.e. it must start with custom_ followed by a three-digit version number, e.g. 'custom_3.7.12'

4. Use a separate version of the Flutter SDK in your project, executed in the project directory:

```bash
fvm use custom_3.7.12
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Running flutter doctor gives 'Error: Unable to find git in your PATH.'

Execute the following command:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
```
